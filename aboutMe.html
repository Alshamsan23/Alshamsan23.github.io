  <div class="aboutMe">

  <p>My Name is Abdulrahman Alshamsan Im 19 years of age, I have been playing games since I was 9 years old. I used to play on my older brother's console when I first started gaming, and ever since I have been addicted to video games. </p>
  <p>On my 13<sup>th</sup> birthday my parents got me my first console, it was a Playstation 4. I couldn't have been happier. but I have upgraded to a gaming pc a couple of years ago and that made me love gaming even more due to a wider variety of games available in PC.</p>
  <p>With my pc passion I knew that I had to choose a major that has a relation to computers.  </p>
